CarbonadoSleepycatDBLegacy version 1.2
--------------------------------------

Carbonado is an extensible, high performance persistence abstraction layer for
Java applications with a relational view to the underlying persistence
technology.

The CarbonadoSleepycatDBLegacy project supports persistence for older versions
of Oracle/Sleepycat Berkeley Database. Specifically, it supports versions 4.1
and 4.2 which had a different Java API. When using newer BDB versions (4.3+),
use CarbonadoSleepycatDB instead.
